    // int is a datatype that stores integer values
    // address is a datatype that stores address like the address of our metamask wallet or we can say that an address value type is specifically designed to hold up to 20Byte, or 160 bits, which is the size of an Ethereum address. Solidity actually offers two address value types: address and address payable . The difference between the two is that address payable can send and transfer Ether.
    // In Solidity, byte refers to 8-bit signed integers. Everything in memory is stored in bits with binary values 0 and 1. The bytes value type in Solidity is a dynamically sized byte array. It is provided for storing information in binary format. Since the array is dynamic, its length can grow or shrink.
